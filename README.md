# Token-Farm

This Project is the result of a tutorial I did in order to learn Solidity and blockchain development, with the final build being a simple Token Farm. This allows the user to deposit a Cryptocurrency into a smart contract, and recieve a different ERC-20 Token. In real world examples this different ERC-20 token could be used in other features of the app, but for now this is just to show functionality.

## Tools Used:
IDE: VS Code
Languages/packages used: Solidity, JS, React JS, Web3, Truffle Suite, Ganache, Chai
