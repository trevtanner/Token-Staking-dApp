# Token Staking dApp

This project is the result of following a tutorial to build a Token Staking De-Fi application for the Ethereum blockchain. This project is a fork from https://github.com/dappuniversity/defi_tutorial, and follows the tutorial to build this app. The code for the smart contracts, as well as the react front end were written by me, with the framework for the app provided by said repository.

## Tools Used:
IDE: VS Code
Languages/packages used: Solidity, React JS, Web3, Truffle Suite, and Chai for unit testing

## Next Steps
Going to use this to build my knowledge of Solidity and smart contracts, working on adding a timelock feature, as well as other examples of smart contract functionality
